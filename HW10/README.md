I like the prospect of this homework since it allows us to explore the internet in more detail. I downloaded the dataset from this website: https://www.bestplaces.net/ , which explored different aspects of life from different locations in the United States. 

I decided to explore Texas (just because). I realized that what I did was relatively straightforward, but I am sure there was more than what meets the eyes here.  

Doing this homework really strengthens my belief in the privacy of Internet. If someone with relatively little exprience like me was able to scrape it, I would not even imagine what someone with the expertise would be able to do. In the age of big data, I strongly believe transparency is key (the book "The weapon of math destruction" explores this issue in depth, I highly recommend). 

Overall, I have some ideas of what I am doing for the scope of this class, but I understand there is more to do than just what I did here.
